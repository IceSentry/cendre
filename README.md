# cendre

A custom renderer for bevy using ash.

## Why?

Bevy's default renderer uses wgpu and is sometimes limited for more advanced features like ray tracing.

I want to learn vulkan and I'm already very familiar with bevy so I'm making this as an alternate renderer for bevy.

I'm basing a lot of this on the videos by Arseny Kapoulkine.
